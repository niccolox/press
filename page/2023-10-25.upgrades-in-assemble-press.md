Aside from a commission going on at a snail's pace,
I had a long break from producing code -
so I'm pleased to be back on the keyboard.

This prior month or so, I changed my primary coding machine from Fedora to [NixOS],
a much more reliable and reproducible base that has room to expand as I learn more.
I had some good help from the group of Nix users at [HacDC] here in the area as I learned.

During my break, I began playing the musical keyboard again,
and made some good progress in learning the harmonics and scales of the black keys.
The immediate response of the machine to my key presses is inspiring,
and helped me gain some energy back for the process of coding.
I hope to bring that philosophy of immediacy to my coding process to keep me engaged.

In my running [code change log][log], you can see a number of changes made today;
these correspond to this application, in the [code/press] codebase.

I added a couple changes so I can keep this application running locally all day long,
and quickly see my changes on the page as I go.
I did this by changing the app port from the usual Phoenix `:4000` -> `:4444`,
so I can happily blog collision-free, as I make progress on other Phoenix applications.
I also came across the `:reload_page_on_css_changes` in [Phoenix.LiveReloader];
an option that really seems should be enabled for all apps.

I'll keep going today to change the appearance of these pages more,
now that I no longer need to use my fingers' energy to click reload for each change.
These pages are looking rather rough as-is,
and I hope I can make them more appealing by the end of the day.

I'm considering a bunch how I can describe my programming process to people;
I usually rely on some unusual approaches as I pursue my education and production.
A quick rhyme I made up as I prepared for Aikido practice yesterday
seems to summarize my idea of shipping quickly, and upgrading gradually:

1. Make one ugly.
2. Make one quick.
3. Make one useful.
4. Make one slick.

Maybe I had been inspired by Aikido's philosophy of four repetitions,
as we learn each of our motions in class.
I guess if I need more than four chances to accomplish my aim,
I should choose a simpler one.
