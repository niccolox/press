Hello. Seems like [`nimble_publisher`][nimble] can render!

[nimble]: https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/misc/nimble_publisher

Colorized Elixir code has been produced by running:

```bash
iex -S mix
```

And in your `iex` shell:

```elixir
Makeup.stylesheet(:monokai_style, "makeup") |> IO.puts()
```
